Planning an outdoor adventure? Outdoor Planner helps you pick the perfect spot.

Add your favorite locations — hiking trails, ski resorts, beaches, parks — and Outdoor Planner fetches real-time hourly weather forecasts for each one. It scores every location based on your personal preferences and highlights the best pick for today, tomorrow, or the weekend.

HOW IT WORKS

2. Set your ideal conditions: preferred temperature, time window, and whether you want sunshine or snow
