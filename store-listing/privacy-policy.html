    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Outdoor Planner ("the App") is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data you enter into the App — saved locations and weather preferences — is stored locally on your device only. This data is never transmitted to our servers because we do not operate any servers.</p>

    <h2>Network Requests</h2>
    <p>The App makes network requests to the following third-party services to provide weather and location search functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open-Meteo Weather API</strong> (api.open-meteo.com) — to fetch hourly weather forecasts. Only latitude and longitude coordinates of your saved locations are sent.</li>
        <li><strong>Open-Meteo Geocoding API</strong> (geocoding-api.open-meteo.com) — to search for locations by name. Only the search text you type is sent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These requests do not include any personal identifiers. Open-Meteo is a free, open-source weather API. Please refer to <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/terms">Open-Meteo's terms</a> for their data practices.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or crash reports</li>
        <li>Location data from your device's GPS</li>
        <li>Any form of tracking or advertising data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not include any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/kjanik70/outdoor-planner">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
